<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>Kaya as a name means the sea, with all its power, life, colours, strength and flexibility. Also means restful place, yew tree, forgiveness; a place of rest and relaxation: a home; stone; willow, wise child; the one with the beautiful body. Kaya in Buddhism refers to the physical and mental body. And that inspired our logo.</p>

<p>Kaya Active is the women's activewear retailer. Our range of high quality inspiring sportswear is perfect for yoga, crossfit, pilates, running, and all kinds of functional movement.</p>

<p>We want to make women feel #morethanbeautiful offering them the chance to be bold, comfortable, confident, active and inspired while wearing our high quality sportswear.</p>

<p>Kaya was born from a love of colours and willingness to experiment – to reinvent “Classics” by playfully mixing colours and patterns offering something truly unique. Our activewear is meticulous in attention to detail, fit, quality and fabric.</p>

<p>We are proud to gain inspiration and collaborate with people and concepts that portray the same free spirit, integrity and creativity.</p>

<p>They may be artists, yogis, designers, musicians, original thinkers, or something that caught our attention.
We strive to make each season a celebration of the values we hold, with Summer/2015 being no exception – an effortless array of vibrant colours produced with the distinctive aesthetics of BrasilSul.</p>

<p>This collection brings together geometric shapes, animal, floral prints and an explosion of colours.</p>
